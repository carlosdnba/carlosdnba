Hi there!

My name is Carlos and I'm a brazilian software developer. I consider myself a full-stack developer (which for me means a backend developer who can also deliver an average frontend :smile:).

As you can see here, recently I've been developing some projects on JavaScript and the AWS Serverless world (React & Lambda) - which I really like. But I  have also coded some small projects on Ruby, Python, and Java. I really enjoy solving logical (and real) problems and automating processes using software.

That's what I have to say about myself. If you want to chat, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/carlosdnba) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-d-barboza/?locale=en_US).
